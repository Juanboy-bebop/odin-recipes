    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups masa harina (corn flower)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shortening, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1 </strong> Combine masa harina, flour, and salt in a bowl. Stir water and egg into the masa mixture;
            add melted shortening and mix well to form dough.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2 </strong> Gently knead dough until moist but retains shape; transfer
            to a bowl, cover bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3 </strong> Divide chilled dough into 15 portions. Roll 1 portion of dough into a ball, while keeping
            remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying. On a lightly floured work surface, pat ball into a 
            3 inch round. Pinch along the edges of the round to make a ridge. Repeat with remaining dough portions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4 </strong> Pour enough oil into a skillet to be about 1/2-inch deep; heat to 365 degrees F(185 degrees C).
            Fry a couple shells in hot oil at a time until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
            Remove sopes from oil using a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel.
            Add more oil as needed and reheat between batches. 
        </li>
    </ol>
